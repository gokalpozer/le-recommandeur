hi rap critic let talk fat joe technically first time since lean back terror squad even though happened rapping seventy-seven want correct little mistake made episode said big pun leader terror squad died head group changed fat joe actuality fat joe founded terror squad big pun joined later weird mean big pun like mr rub face earth curse family children like amityville drill nerves cavity filling mean always came guy charge fat joe sample lyric twins mean bad nt want think sucks hes standing next villain without remorse willing boss forever take cheddar like child support gon na look like second command whoever addition kinda big pun became popular short amount time hits like still player charting around ninety-eight fat joe really big hit two thousand and two song luv guess thugs need love songs although like always said talk anything long make interesting pun asshole rap personality pat see man brash upfront delivery kind endearing bet ya man ca nt like ca nt work middle cause thang little nt wan na player player fuck lot made likable overthetopness lyricism made enjoyable listen well outstanding rhyming abilities addition pun fun mean guy looked like knew something compensate appearance making love okay sex song nothing lovey dove rip prick ya hooters sick could nt measure dick six rulers making kind song always came guy take seriously litte brown hairs everywhere however fat joe well like said bad came like trying fit crowd stand mean god sake ashanti singing chorus time go thugs need love singer ja rule songs fact love got got babe yeah yeah yall love ja rule chorus ashanti well video obviously voice jeez fat joe trying trick people thinking ja rule song mean nt verse anywhere purpose maybe presence ubiquitous around time essence ja rule started spilling thugs need love songs singing love ja got go babe look confused keep singing wha love ja us okay wasted enough time song good well let start actually looking chorus love got got babe yeah yeah uh okay obvious homage tina turner song love got physical logical must try ignore means oh love got got love second hand emotion song woman trying protect feelings devaluing idea love nothing chemical reaction arousing stimuli convince meaningless someone nt want hurt uses verses build theme chorus okay song love got got babe yeah yeah uh start song love got love got referring say something intro missed say irv gotti love got irv gotti point trying make phrase like love got need lyric something first know referring nt told referring feels like hey know song exists referencing even rap music english pronoun like refers noun something give wait getting ahead maybe explain love us trust babe okay given little context saying love together trust okay assume singer rapper relationship things nt going well relationship well let see rapper fat joe responds says yeah slow baby let know gate nt go lady long pause well cut girl get aroused look eye talk much man ruinin high well cut say got ta man love okay back minute let try figure chorus love supposed trust together got first thing thought say jump yeah slow baby let know gate nt go lady kinda conversation picturing girl hey babe love want make sure relationship based us trusting eachother guy nt oral sex girl okay nt think directly relates talking guy trust never oral sex girl nt gon na work next say girl get aroused look eye talk much man ruinin high exactly romantic followup telling girl wo nt go say got ta man love wha wait minute wait minute boyfriend well hell wait person cheating boyfriend guess gives chorus better context like saying cheating boyfriend purely want sex love question said obviously one night stand guy freaking boyfriend back home pretty sure one assumption love anything bring liking asking cleaning products fishing well nothing even close category brought think must something song listen lyrics obvious love sex feels like threw word love make people think love song see hate thugs need love songs always air deception like oh said love lot chorus naw really trying get relationship dude say want one night stand guarantee groupies gon na nt need lie say got ta man love love got ta little menage nothing love nothing inherently three way however wanted could go one may confusing love sex someone conflicted feel never seem pretty comfortable going ambiguity happening nt many questions floating around could slide could come love love wait thought clear love involved situation change third girl involved love dont ah whatever mommy know got issues got ta man need understand got something hold telling go back boyfriend sounds like saying hey girl got man need understand got something got love caring relationship even though perfect well interesting judging rest song though probably means last line vague idea talking got something meatball sub nt finish mean fat joe okay ca nt maybe using vague phrase talk hot ass fat frame little thought tattoo chest name middle would bring like get kick knowing name person cheating hater crush lot oh okay malicious like nt hate guy girl cheating really likes sex although think funny uses edited version phrase big pun song still playa cases pretty sure edit intended mean gets easily smitten lot chicks know develops crush however first heard edited version well say verb crushing nt exactly lend positive image describing sexual exploits overweight men hope women always top trying say fault cause love kid maybe chain whip nt know nt know ca nt figure women would possibly attracted popular rapper brags popping bottles driving fancy cars deductive reasoning led believe women purely attracted necklace well gee fat joe hate burst bubble girls attracted winning personality women ca nt get enough fact tell talk much swoon sigh complete refusal reciprocate oral sex came heart cheat need sing song yep already made choice ruin trust relationship nt shy made song look eyes stoppin want joey crack top wants joey crack top like fat joe butt nt know ashanti wait sorry apparently one fat joe aliases joey crack guessing drug dealing name wait nt make sense since drug dealers usually use code names nt directly allude drugs respectable drug kingpin would name mikey illegal drug dealer kinda ruins point code name convinced line totally fat joe sitting ashanti nt want stacks yeah break back know nt think light airy singing voice matching topic talking like singing talking something innocent like nt want cash hold hand actually singing something along lines nt want money rupture spinal cord hey maybe sort thing maybe really likes body squashed obese men mean really listen imagine fat guy across room bellyflop ashanti come put oooon imitating ashanti portly lover imma put ya girl okay enough overall give song twenty-five five beat fun admittedly chorus enjoyable enough sing along falls apart soon start look construction lyrics fat joe terrible seems lack energy personality takes make type song forgivable left yet another bland character sex someone else girlfriend nt say anything liven fellas gets kinda old well rap critic analyze lyrics one else comes towards cameraembedshare
