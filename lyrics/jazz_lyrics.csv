addition arguing history tradition compelling interests rights proponents warn deviating tradition oppositesex marriage destabilize institution marriage proponents suggest legalizing samesex marriage sever link marriage procreation argue samesex coupleswho procreate naturallyare allowed marry state sanction idea marriage vehicle adults emotional fulfillment simply framework parenthood according proponents adults focal point marriage logical grounds reinforce stabilizing norms like sexual exclusivity permanence monogamy exist benefit children recognize cases owe substantial deference predictive judgments virginia general assembly proponents purport speak turner broad sys inc v fcc five hundred and twenty us one hundred and eighty one hundred and ninety-five one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-seven however even view proponents theories rosecolored glasses conclude unfounded two key reasons first supreme court rejected view marriage procreation griswold v connecticut upheld married couples right procreate articulated view marriage nothing children marriage coming together better worse hopefully enduring intimate degree sacred association promotes way life causes harmony living political faiths bilateral loyalty commercial social projects yet association noble purpose involved prior decisions three hundred and eighty-one us forty-eight thousand, five hundred and eighty-six see also turner four hundred and eighty-two us nine thousand, five hundred and ninety-six describing many nonprocreative purposes marriage fact marriage stabilizing norms endured five decades since supreme court made pronouncement weakens argument couples remain monogamous marriages sake offspring second primary support proponents offer theory legacy wholly unrelated legal change marriage nofault divorce although nofault divorce certainly altered realities married life making easier couples end relationships reason think legalizing samesex marriage similar destabilizing effect fact logical think samesex couples want access marriage take advantage hallmarks including faithfulness permanence allowing loving committed samesex couples marry recognizing outofstate marriages strengthen institution marriage therefore reject proponents concerns four responsible procreation next proponents contend virginia marriage laws differentiation oppositesex samesex couples stems fact unintended pregnancies result samesex unions sanctioning oppositesex marriages virginia marriage laws provid stability types relationships result unplanned pregnancies thereby avoiding diminishing negative outcomes often associated unintended children proponents allege children born unwed parents face significant risk raised unstable families harmful development virginia course duty highest order protect interests minor children particularly tender years palmore v sidoti four hundred and sixty-six us four hundred and twenty-nine four hundred and thirty-three one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four however virginia marriage laws appropriately tailored interest virginia sought ensure responsible procreation via virginia marriage laws laws woefully underinclusive samesex couples category couples reproduce accidentally example oppositesex couples procreate unintentionally include postmenopausal woman individual medical condition prevents unassisted conception proponents attempt downplay similarity samesex couples infertile oppositesex couples three ways first point sterile individuals could remedy fertility future medical advances potentiality however explain virginia treat samesex infertile oppositesex couples differently course latter group infertility second proponents posit even one member manwoman couple sterile member may suggest fifty-five without marriage monogamy mandate fertile individual likely unintended child third party contend due possibility even oppositesex couples procreate need marriage channel procreative activity way samesex couples proponents argument assumes individuals samesex relationships never oppositesex sexual partners simply case third proponents imply marrying infertile oppositesex couples set positive example couples unintended children thereby encouraging marry see reason committed samesex couples serve similar role models therefore reject proponents attempts differentiate samesex couples couples procreate accidentally samesex couples infertile oppositesex couples similarly situated equal protection clause counsels treating groups differently see city cleburne four hundred and seventy-three us four hundred and thirty-nine explaining equal protection clause essentially direction persons similarly situated treated alike due virginia marriage laws underinclusivity case resembles city cleburne v cleburne living center inc city cleburne supreme court struck city law required group homes intellectually disabled obtain special use permit id forty-four thousand, seven hundred and fifty city impose requirement similar structures apartment complexes nursing homes id four hundred and forty-seven court determined permit requirement underinclusive city motivation must rest irrational prejudice rendering law unconstitutional id four hundred and fifty light virginia marriage laws extreme underinclusivity forced draw conclusion case proponents responsible procreation argument falters another reason well strict scrutiny requires state means compelling interest see shaw five hundred and seventeen us nine hundred and fifteen although always provided precise guidance closely means must serve end justification compelling interest always expected legislative action would substantially address achieve avowed purpose prohibiting samesex couples marrying ignoring outofstate marriages serve virginia goal preventing outofwedlock births although samesex couples procreate accidentally children via methods according amicus brief filed dr gary j gates two thousand and ten us census two thousand, five hundred samesex couples raising four thousand children age eighteen virginia virginia marriage laws therefore increase number children raised unmarried parents proponents acknowledge samesex couples become parents contend however state interest channeling samesex couples procreative activities marriage samesex couples bring children relationship intentional choice preplanned action accordingly hose couples neither advance threaten society public purpose marriage stabilizing parental relationships benefit children manner degree sexual relationships men women support argument proponents invoke supreme court decision johnson v robison four hundred and fifteen us three hundred and sixty-one one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-four johnson concerned

promoted government goal making military service attractive extending benefits conscientious objectors whose religious beliefs precluded military service objective contrast stable marital relationship attractive regardless couple procreative ability allowing infertile oppositesex couples marry nothing government goal channeling procreative conduct marriage thus excluding samesex couples marriage due inability unintended children makes little sense johnson therefore alter conclusion barring samesex couples access marriage nothing virginia interest responsible procreation five optimal

importance genderdifferentiated parenting argue sanctioning samesex marriage deprive children benefit raised mother father distinct parenting styles essence proponents argue virginia marriage laws

reached similar conclusion windsor observed failing recognize samesex marriages humiliates tens thousands children raised samesex couples makes even difficult children understand integrity closeness family concord families community daily lives one hundred and thirty-three ct two thousand, six hundred and ninety-four find arguments opponents amici make issue extremely persuasive however need resolve dispute proponents optimal childrearing argument falters least two reasons first heightened scrutiny states support law using overbroad generalizations different talents capacities preferences groups question united states v virginia five hundred and eighteen us five hundred and fifteen fifty-three thousand, three hundred and thirty-four one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-six rejecting inherent differences men women justification excluding women traditionally allmale military college see also stanley v illinois four hundred and five us six hundred and forty-five sixty-five thousand, six hundred and fifty-eight one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two holding state could presume unmarried fathers unfit parents proponents statements regarding samesex couples parenting ability certainly qualify overbroad generalizations second explain strict scrutiny requires congruity law means end congruity absent absolutely reason suspect prohibiting samesex couples marrying refusing recognize outofstate marriages cause samesex couples raise fewer children impel married oppositesex couples raise children virginia marriage laws therefore virginia interest channeling children optimal families even accept dubious proposition samesex couples less capable parents proponents arguments based overbroad generalizations samesex parents link banning samesex marriage promoting optimal childrearing aim support virginia marriage laws proponents justifications virginia marriage laws therefore fail laws survive strict scrutiny v foregoing reasons conclude virginia marriage laws violate due process equal protection clauses fourteenth amendment extent prevent samesex couples marrying prohibit virginia recognizing samesex couples lawful outofstate marriages therefore affirm district court grant plaintiffs motion summary judgment decision enjoin enforcement virginia marriage laws able resolve merits opponents claims need consider alternative request preliminary injunction
